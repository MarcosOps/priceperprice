## CircleCI Pipeline

This project includes a CircleCI pipeline that builds an Android APK and stores it as an artifact in CircleCI.

### How it works

1. The pipeline uses the `cimg/android:2023.08-node` Docker image, which includes Node.js and Android SDK.
2. It installs dependencies, including Expo CLI and EAS CLI.
3. It configures EAS to build the APK locally.
4. It creates placeholder images for the app icon and splash screen.
5. It builds the APK using EAS CLI.
6. It stores the APK as an artifact in CircleCI.

### How to use

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Connect your GitHub repository to CircleCI.
3. CircleCI will automatically build the APK when you push to the repository.
4. You can download the APK from the Artifacts tab in the CircleCI dashboard.

### Customization

You can customize the build process by modifying the following files:

- `.circleci/config.yml`: CircleCI configuration
- `eas.json`: EAS build configuration
- `app.json`: Expo app configuration
