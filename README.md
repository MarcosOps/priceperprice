## How to Run Locally and Create an APK

### 1. Run for Development (using Expo Go)

This is the easiest way to get started and test your app during development.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the Metro Bundler:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    This will open a new tab in your browser with the Expo Dev Tools.

3.  **Run on Your Device/Emulator:**
    *   **iOS:** Open the Camera app on your iPhone/iPad and scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or Expo Dev Tools. Follow the prompts to open the project in the Expo Go app.
    *   **Android:** Open the Expo Go app on your Android device and scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or Expo Dev Tools.

    Alternatively, you can press `i` in the terminal to open the iOS Simulator or `a` to open the Android Emulator (if configured).

### 2. Build an APK for a Device

If you need a standalone Android application package (.apk) to install directly on a device, follow these steps. This process requires native build tools (Android SDK, Java) to be set up on your machine.

1.  **Generate Native Android Project Files:**
    If you don't have an `android` folder in your project root, or if you've deleted it, you need to generate the native project files. This command creates the `android` directory with all necessary native code and configurations.
    ```bash
    npx expo prebuild --platform android
    ```
    *Note: If you have made manual changes to the `android` folder, they will be overwritten by this command. Ensure you back up any custom native code.*

2.  **Navigate to the Android Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd android
    ```

3.  **Build the Release APK:**
    This command compiles your Android project and generates a release-ready APK.
    ```bash
    ./gradlew assembleRelease
    ```
    The generated APK will be located at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`.

4.  **Install the APK on a Device (Optional):**
    Ensure your Android device has USB debugging enabled and is connected to your computer.
    ```bash
    adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
    ```
    *Replace `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` with the actual path to your generated APK if it differs.*

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation or building, you can try resetting the project:

```bash
npm run reset
```
This will clean your project by removing `node_modules` and reinstalling the dependencies.

#### How to Capture Logcat for Debugging

If your app crashes on a device, capturing the logcat output is crucial for diagnosing the issue. This will provide detailed error messages and stack traces.

1.  **Enable USB Debugging on your Android device:**
    *   Go to `Settings` > `About phone` (or `About device`).
    *   Tap "Build number" seven times rapidly until you see a message that "Developer options" are enabled.
    *   Go back to `Settings` > `System` (or `Developer options` directly if it appears in the main settings list).
    *   Find and enable "USB debugging."

2.  **Connect your Android device to your computer:**
    *   Use a USB cable to connect your phone to your computer.
    *   On your phone, you might see a pop-up asking to "Allow USB debugging." Tap "OK."

3.  **Verify device connection:**
    Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    adb devices
    ```
    You should see your device listed.

4.  **Capture the logs:**
    Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    adb logcat -s "AndroidRuntime:E *:S" > app_crash_log_filtered.txt
    ```
    *   Immediately after running this command, try to open your app on the Android device. Let it crash.
    *   Once the app crashes, go back to your terminal and press `Ctrl+C` (or `Cmd+C` on Mac) to stop the logcat capture.

    A file named `app_crash_log_filtered.txt` will be created in your current directory (`/Users/marcosfeitoza/`). This file will contain only error messages, making it easier to pinpoint the issue.
